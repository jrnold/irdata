The International Relations Database
=====================================

I got tired of the merging and cleaning of international relations data, so
I put it all together in a relational database.

It is similar to `EUGene <http://eugenesoftware.org/>`_, but uses an
relational database backend, and is much less complete.

The database currently includes the following datasets:

- COW State System Membership 2008.1 http://www.correlatesofwar.org/
- COW Wars v 4.0 http://www.correlatesofwar.org/ (Inter-, Intra-, and Non-State Wars)
- COW Wars v 3.0 http://www.correlatesofwar.org/
- COW National Material Capabilities v 4.0 http://www.correlatesofwar.org/
- COW Direct Contiguity v 3.1 http://www.correlatesofwar.org/
- Polity IV (2010) http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/inscr.htm
- Kristian Skrede Gleditsh (KSG) `List of independent states <http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/statelist.html>`_
- Kristian Skrede Gleditsh (KSG) `Modified Polity data <http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/polity.html>`_
