# All from http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/Capabilities/NMC_Codebook_v4_0.pdf
nmc_tpopqualitycode:
  A: Value from identified source
  B: Linear Interpolation from identified sources
  C: Linear Interpolation from at least one unidentified source
  D: Regression from identified sources
  E: Regression from at least one unidentified source
  F: Extrapolation from identified sources
  G: Extrapolation from at least one unidentified source
  M: Missing value.
nmc_tpopanomalycode:
  A: No Anomaly (< 2% change)
  B: Explained Inconsistency (e.g. change in territory, loss in wartime)
  C: Change of Sources (between 2 non-UN sources or 1 non-UN to UN source)
  D: Change of UN Sources
  E: UN Internal Inconsistency within same UN source
  F: Internal inconsistency within non-UN source
  G: Unexplained Anomaly
nmc_upopqualitycode:
  A: Value from UN Demographic
  B: "Assumed 0 (Ex.: Vanuatu)"
  C: Linear Interpolation from identified sources
  D: Linear Interpolation from at least one unidentified source
  E: Extrapolation from identified sources
  F: Extrapolation from at least one unidentified source
nmc_irstqualitycode:
  A: Value from identified source
  B: No known productionâ€”assumed to be zero
  C: COW2 interpolation
  D: Data from earlier COW data set, but with missing or unidentified source
  E: 
  F: 
  M: Missing value
nmc_irstanomalycode:
  A: No anomaly
  B: No known production capability to production 
  C: Changes of sources 
  D: Internal source inconsistency 
  E: Unexplained anomaly
nmc_pecqualitycode:
  A: All Components Present; or, only electricity interpolated from 1900-1945
  B: All Components known, but averaged. Often happens when a state changes reporting units (for example, moving fro calendar years to fiscal years or vice-versa). 
  C: Some (but not all) component data points interpolated
  D: All component data points interpolated 
  E: Log Linear Extrapolation based on growth rates
  F: 
  M: Missing Data Values
nmc_pecanomalycode:
  A: No Anomaly (< 2% change)
  B: Explained Inconsistency (e.g. change in territory, loss in wartime)
  C: Change of Sources (between 2 non-UN sources or 1 non-UN to UN source)
  D: Change of UN Sources
  E: UN Internal Inconsistency within same UN source
  F: Internal inconsistency within non-UN source
  G: Unexplained Anomaly
