  National Material Capabilities Data (v 4)

  From http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/Capabilities/nmc4.htm
  
     The National Material Capabilites data set contains annual values
     for total population, urban population, iron and steel
     production, energy consumption, military personnel, and military
     expenditure of all state members, currently from 1816-2007. The
     widely-used Composite Index of National Capability (CINC) index
     is based on these six variables and included in the data set.

  See http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/Capabilities/NMC_Codebook_v4_0.pdf for
  more documentation.
