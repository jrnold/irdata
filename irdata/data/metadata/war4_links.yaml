  Relationships between COW Wars (v. 4)

  COW Wars can transform into different wars when the nature of the
  war fundamentally changes its category. This table contains all of
  these relationships, which appear in the `TransFrom` and `TransTo`
  columns of the data sources.

  As the `Inter State Wars Codebook
  <http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/WarData_NEW/InterStateWars_Codebook.pdf>`_
  explains:

     One particular addition to this version of the data is information concerning war
     “transformations.” Though the understanding of wars being transformed or changing
     categories goes back to the origins of the COW project and Wages of War, it is only in
     this version of the data that specific variables addressing such transformations have been
     added. Wars are often not as clearly delineated as our typologies, and can often contain
     elements of different types of wars. Furthermore, a conflict can, over its life span,
     metamorphose from one type of war to another. COW has attempted to deal with such
     complexity by relying on two major determinants: the principle of the mutual exclusivity
     of wars, and the classification of wars based upon the decision concerning which parties
     are doing the “bulk of the fighting.” Thus, if a war changes so that one or more of the
     parties doing the bulk of the fighting changes, the initial war ends and the conflict is
     transformed into a war of a second type. Such transformations can be seen in all types of
     war: for example, if another state intervenes in an intra-state war on the side of the non-
     state forces, and then takes over the bulk of the fighting, the war is transformed into an
     inter-state war between the two states. Conversely, inter-state wars can also be
